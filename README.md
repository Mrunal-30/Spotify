# Spotify
This project is a feature-rich Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to deliver a seamless and interactive music streaming experience. Designed with responsiveness in mind, it ensures smooth functionality and appealing visuals across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The user interface is crafted to closely mimic Spotify's sleek and modern design, incorporating animations, hover effects, and a dynamic layout that adapts to screen sizes effortlessly.

The clone includes a fully functional music player with essential controls such as play, pause, next, and previous track navigation, as well as volume adjustment and progress tracking through a seek bar. Users can interact with a playlist management system, allowing them to create, delete, and switch between playlists effortlessly. Additional features include a search bar for browsing through songs and artists, shuffle and repeat options for playback, and an interactive now-playing section displaying the current track's details, such as the title, artist, and album art.

This project is hosted on a live platform, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The hosting ensures that users can test and explore the functionality without the need for a local setup. The codebase is structured and well-documented, making it an excellent reference for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand responsive design and JavaScript-based interactivity in web development.
